# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
    It is useful when you need to write a set of parameters, certain conditions needing to be met leading to certain results. It can help the code produce the desired message or output depending on the values of the given variables.
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
    Nothing, I am perfect. But in all seriousness, I do think I approached this particular assignment well. I had my notebook opened next to me, and whenever I needed a reminder, the notes were right there. 
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
    I liked when I was able to quickly identify the necessary steps, and then quickly recalled the information and designed the code.
